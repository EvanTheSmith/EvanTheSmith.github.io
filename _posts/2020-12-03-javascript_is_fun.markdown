JavaScript is fun, it's powerful, and although you can do so much with Ruby and its correlating frameworks Sinatra and Rails, JavaScript to me truly feels like a real job skill. That and I personally prefer the curly bracket/semicolon way of arranging lines of code; it just looks better and makes sense to me.

The majority of my project this time was spent thinking of a project. I like clear direction. Being told "there is a huge variety of applications that you might build," really kind of overwhelmed me. This project was also the first time I found life getting in the way and truly straining my ability to focus. It was good, real-world experience. And to my chagrin, the worst experiences often provide the best experience, from a utility perspective at least.

One interesting dichotomy I have noticed in JavaScript is the contrast between **document.querySelector** series of commands versus **document.getElementBy(...)**. Both work to point at different nodes in the DOM, but I find myself using querySelector the vast majority of the time. I wonder if that will change? And I wonder which my fellow students prefer.

On a closing note, I vastly prefer the the console in Google Chrome over the alternative in a VS Code environment. It makes me feel like a real Web developer. The way it dynamically tries to highlight what it thinks you want as you type is so cool. So much more powerful and intuitive. I think I would really like JavaScript in a professional setting.
