Here I finally am at the end of my Flatiron journey. I have learned several programming languages, and I finally have enough vocabulary in them to make educated guesses that actually ... work! This helps a ton with refactoring, but it is *the* best feeling to not have to Google something because I just have an intuition on how to do it ... even something brand new. Every hurdle and bug is its own learning experience, and I'm constantly figuring out how to do new things and to do old things better.

Of everything I have learned this past year, React stands out to me. React is my new favorite thing.

JavaScript is so powerful, but you have to tap into that power with verbose, specific code. You have to hold its hand and walk it through each step. Enter React: it is like JavaScript with a brain of its own. It can tell one element to refresh, another to go away, and it just keep things so organized, human-readable and sensible. It's great!

JavaScript is like legos. React is like legos. But where JavaScript legos are the little 1x1 pieces that you need a lot of imagination to use, React is the themed sets with characters, cars and complex objects that clearly serve a purpose. You can build something with either, but React is **so** much easier and definitely more fun.

I loved legos growing up, and that love for creativity and design extends to coding. I love coding, and I so look forward to what I will build in the future and everything I can learn along the way.
